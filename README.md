This is a simple Phyton3 script wich generates a customable IRIG-B wav-file (format "A", left and right channel identic). After Generating the file it opens a plot, wich displays the waveform, bits and position markers. I proggramed it to test Hardware but you can also just listen to the wunderful sound of IRIG :-)
